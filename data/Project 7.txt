Project 7 â€“ Cross-Source Record Linking
- Files: Project7SourceA.csv (ground-truth-ish), Project7SourceB.csv (noisy)
- Description: Overlapping invoices with varying identifiers (exact, digits-only, embedded tokens, prefixes), date drift, minor rounding, and injected ambiguities to require tie-breakers.
- Suggested fields to consider: primary ids (invoice_id vs ref_code), amounts, dates, customer_name/email, purchase orders.
